# ImageFeatureRegistration
Python image registration matching extracted feature descriptors

Dataset 2 ome-zarrs included: the result of stitching 3 x 3 tiles for 2 successive slices. The slices have also been scaled down by a factor of 8 resulting in about 2k x 2k pixels. So effectively this is a very small subset of the publicly available dataset: [EMPIAR-12193](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/EMPIAR-12193/)
